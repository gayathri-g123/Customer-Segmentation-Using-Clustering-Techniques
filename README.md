# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering-Techniques
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their spending habits, transaction patterns, and product diversity. The analysis employs K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering techniques to generate actionable insights for improving customer engagement and revenue optimization.

Clustering Algorithms: K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.

Cluster Profiling: Provides insights into customer groups, such as high spenders and low-frequency shoppers.

Visualization: PCA-based 2D projections of clusters for better interpretation.

Performance Metrics: Evaluates clustering quality using the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI).
